<h2>1. Foundation of DevOps </h2>
<h3>Question 1: What is Devops </h3>
It is a cultural and technical movement that aims to improve collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams.
key aspects. It is a culture adopted to improve delivery.
<h3>Briefly explain the core principles </h3>
the Core principles include 
a) Automation: Streamlining repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and infrasrure provisioning.
COllaboration: breaking down silos betweeen development and opearions teams to work more effiecntly together.
CI/CD: continous Integration and continous Integration. This is to ensure that code chnages are automatically tested and deployed, leading to faster, more reliable releases.
Monitorijng and Feedback: Using real time insights to conitnously improve systems and processes.
<h2>2. DevOps Lifecycle Stages</h2>
<h3>Explain each of the following stages in 1–2 sentences:
Planning
Development
Building
Testing
Release
Deployment
Operations
Monitoring</h3>
<h4>Planning:This is hwere requirements are defined, define goals and prioriotize tasks.some tools used are jira, confulence and trello</h4>
<h4>Development: this is where coding begins. developers build features, fix bugs and turn the pan into tangible thing. Tools include: Git, Gitlab, GitHub, Bitbucket</h4>
<h4>Build:Code is compiled and packaged, transforming raw files into executable formats that are ready for testing and deployment. Tools include: Maven, Gradle, Bazel  </h4>
<h4>Testing: Automated testing, security checks, and perfomance validation. one of the secuirty checks is checking if the password is not public. Tools include Selenium, JUnit, SonarQube(identify vulnerabilities within the code).</h4>
<h4>Release: it is a point where you need to be careful, getting approval, chnage, and prepare artifacts. this is where you get the greenlight. tools include Jenkins, Github Actions, ArgoCd</h4>
<h4>Deployment: The software is pushed into its live environment where users can access it often automated to minimize errors. Tools include: Docker, Kuberneetes, Terraform</h4>
<h4>Operations: Now it’s all about keeping the system healthy and responsive, handling performance, scaling, and daily tasks. Tools include: Ansible, puppete, chef</h4>
<h4>Monitoring: Constant eyes on the systemtracking logs, performance, and user behavior to catch issues early and guide future improvements. Tools used inlude (Grafana, ELK stack, etc)</h4>
